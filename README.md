# Installation
To install this package, use composer:
```bash
composer require mateusjunges/laravel-trackable-jobs
```

You can publish the configuration file with this command:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=trackable-jobs-config
```

Run `php artisan migrate` to migrate the table needed by this package, and now you are good to go!

# Usage
## Tracking jobs
To start tracking your jobs, you just need to use the `Junges\TrackableJobs\Concerns\Trackable` trait in the job you want to track.
For example, let's say you want to track the status of `ProcessPodcastJob`, just add the `Trackable` trait into your job:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Jobs;

use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Bus\Dispatchable;
use Illuminate\Queue\InteractsWithQueue;
use Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels;
use Junges\TrackableJobs\Concerns\Trackable;

class ProcessPodcastJob implements ShouldQueue
{
    use Dispatchable, InteractsWithQueue, Queueable, SerializesModels, Trackable;

    public function handle()
    {
        //
    }
}
```

This trait provides 3 methods to your job: `__construct`, `failed` and `middleware`. It also adds a `model` public property to the job class.
If you want to override any of the methods, you must copy and paste (because you can't use `parent` for traits) the content of each one inside your class,
so this package still work as intended.

For example: if you need to change the constructor of your job, you can use the `Junges\TrackableJobs\Concerns\Trackable` and alias the `__construct` with some other name, for example:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Jobs;

use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Bus\Dispatchable;
use Illuminate\Queue\InteractsWithQueue;
use Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels;
use Junges\TrackableJobs\Concerns\Trackable;
use App\Models\Podcast;
use Junges\TrackableJobs\Models\TrackedJob;

class ProcessPodcastJob implements ShouldQueue
{
    use Dispatchable, InteractsWithQueue, Queueable, SerializesModels, Trackable {
        __construct as __baseConstruct;
    }

    public function __construct(Podcast $podcast)
    {
         $this->__baseConstruct($podcast);
         
         // Add your code here.
    }

    public function handle()
    {
        //
    }
}
```
It can be done with any method you want to change.

This package will store the last status of your job, which can be `queued`, `started`, `failed` or `finished`. Also, it stores the 
`started_at` and `finished_at` timestamps for each tracked job.

To use it, you just need to pass any model to your Job constructor:

```php
dispatch(new ProcessPodcastJob($podcast));
```

Once this trait is added to your job, your job progress will be persisted to the database. You can configure the table name by publishing this package configuration file:

```shell
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=trackable-jobs-config
```

This command will create a new config file in `config/trackable-jobs.php`, with this content:

```php
<?php

return [
    /*
     | The table where the tracked jobs will be stored.
     | By default, it's called 'tracked_jobs'.
     */
    'tables' => [
        'tracked_jobs' => 'tracked_jobs',
    ],
    'using_uuid' => false,
];
```


## Tracking job chains
Laravel supports job chaining out of the box:

```php
Bus::dispatchChain([
    new OptimizePodcast($podcast),
    new CompressPodcast($podcast),
    new ReleasePodcast($podcast)
])->dispatch();
```

It's a nice, fluent way of saying "Run this jobs sequentially, one after the previous one is complete.".

If you have a task which takes some steps to be completed, you can track the job chain used to do that and know the 
status for each job. 
If you are releasing a new podcast, for example, and it has to be optimized, compressed and released, you can track 
this steps by adding a `steps` relationship to your `Podcast` model:

```php
public function steps()
{
    return $this->morphMany(Junges\TrackableJobs\Models\TrackedJob::class, 'trackable');
}
```

Now, you can have the status of each job that should be processed to release your podcast:

```php
$steps = Podcast::find($id)->steps()->get();
```

## Persist the output of a job
To persist the output of your job to the database, you only need to return something from your job. By default, if your job throws an exception, the output stored in the database will be the message of the given exception. If your job finishes successfully, you don't have to return anything, but you can store it's output by just returning something after the job is done. For example:

```php
public function handle()
{
    //Do your stuff here
    
    return "Job finished successfully";
}
```
The string `Job finished successfully` will be stored as the output of this job.


## Extending the `TrackedJob` model.
If, for some reason, you need to use your own custom model to the TrackedJob table, you can just create a new model
and extend the existing `Junges\TrackableJobs\Models\TrackedJob::class`.
Then, you need to bind the `Junges\TrackableJobs\Contracts\TrackableJobContract` to the new model, within your `AppServiceProvider`:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Providers;

use App\Models\YourCustomModel;
use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;
use Junges\TrackableJobs\Contracts\TrackableJobContract;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    /**
     * Register any application services.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function register()
    {
        $this->app->bind(TrackableJobContract::class, YourCustomModel::class);
    }

    /**
     * Bootstrap any application services.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function boot()
    {
        //
    }
}
```

## Using UUIDs
To use UUIDs with this package, the only additional configuration you need to do is change the `using_uuid` to `true`, in `config/trackable-jobs.php`.
Then it will automatically start using UUID's to store the tracked jobs and, if the model related to the tracked job
also uses UUID, it will be stored to the database in the `trackable_id` field.

## Pruning old Tracked Jobs
If you want to prune your old tracked jobs, you can set the `prunable_after` config with the amount of days you want your models
to keep in your database. For example, if you set the `prunable_after` to `30`, all models older than 30 days 
will be deleted.
